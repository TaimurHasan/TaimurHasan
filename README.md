## Hi, I'm Taimur! ðŸ‘‹

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer specializing in React, Javascript, and the MERN Stack.

Originally, I am a business school graduate and finance professional. I developed a passion for building things and making lives easier with technology when creating powerful process improvement and data visualization tools across multiple finance roles. I enjoy using my fundamental business knowledge and consumer oriented experiences, along with my knowledge of multiple technical languages, to create exceptional applications and unique solutions. I believe that my background in business has provided me with the perfect balance between cross-functional, collaborative work and a focused 'heads-down' approach to problem-solving.

Within my profile and my repositories, you will find my journey in the world of tech. To any users, I hope my applications provide you with simple solutions to your daily requirements and inconveniences. To any developers, I eagerly anticipate collaborating with and learning from you, and hope my code can inspire you. I look forward to continuing my passion and pursuit of learning.
